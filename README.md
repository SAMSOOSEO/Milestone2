# Milestone2
1. Data Acquisition & EDA Execution
- The dataset was downloaded directly from Kaggle, including:
"fhvhv_tripdata_2019-02.parquet",
"fhvhv_tripdata_2019-03.parquet",
"fhvhv_tripdata_2019-04.parquet",
"fhvhv_tripdata_2019-05.parquet",
"fhvhv_tripdata_2019-06.parquet".
- The total dataset size is approximately 2.6 GB.
- Due to capacity issues on Expanse SDSC, analysis was performed on a local machine using a relatively smaller dataset.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Process
- Schema inspection
- Dataset size analysis (Raw data, number of columns)
- Data table format verification
- Data distribution over time (Taxi service trip counts across different providers)
- Bar chart visualization of data distribution
- Column-based calculations (Time computations)
- Group-wise mean and median calculations based on computed time differences
- Scatter plot visualization was planned but could not be executed due to computing limitations on the local PC
